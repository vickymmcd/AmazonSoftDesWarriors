# Project Overview
Have you ever boughten a handy Swiss army knife, only to realize that if you had waited a couple of weeks you would have saved over $30? Does this keep happening dispite looking at the best deals online? Well Super Shoppers, a final project created for Software Design at Olin College in Spring of 2017 will allow you to determine just when the price is cheapest.

In addition to the obvious motivations of saving money, we wanted to explore this particular idea because we wanted to use statistical modeling and machine learning in order to make valuable predictions. This project allowed us to learn about these two topics while also being useful. We implemented a SARIMA model ( Seasonal Auto Regression Integrated Moving Average ) that takes current price values and fits them based on past price values. How SARIMA works is that it takes in a stationary time series, which was a result of differencing our inputed data time series along with its parameters in addition to differencing the seasonality and finding the parameters for the seasonality of the data. In the end, the model is able to account for the time dependencies and the seasonalitys in order to predict future prices.

With this model, our finished project is a website that allows users to enter what product they would like buy and when they would like to buy it by. The website then indicates when will be the cheapest day to buy this particular product.
