# The Story of us
We initially planned on using a machine learning algorithm-

finding price histories is hard, Traktor costs money unless you trick it-

Switch to different machine learning algorithm-

Get data collection working-

got formatting mostly working-

Got an early version of interpreter, but without predictive capabilities-

Found out about seasonality and stuff-

Started graphing using Bokeh-

Implemented ARIMA, mostly-

Changed to using SARIMA-

Started working with different data sources for longer histories-
