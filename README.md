# Super Shoppers
This is the repository for a final project in Software Design at Olin College created in spring of 2017. The team consists of Noah Rivkin, Victoria McDermott, Katya Donovan, and Samantha Young. Project proposal can be found at https://github.com/vickymmcd/AmazonSoftDesWarriors/blob/master/ProjectProposal.pdf.
